This resource allows you to configure a Request Access Profile instance in ConductorOne.
When creating a Request Access Profile you must provide a display name. Optionally, you can configure if the access profile is published, visible to everyone, and provide a description.
You can then configure exactly who should be able to see the access profile, and what entitlements should be requestable with the `access_profile_visibility_bindings_resource`
and `access_profile_entitlement_bindings_resource` resources.
