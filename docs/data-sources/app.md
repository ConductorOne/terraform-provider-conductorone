# conductorone_app (Data Source)

App DataSource

The App datasource allows you to retrieve an App instance by `display_name` (case insensitive), or `id` in ConductorOne.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "conductorone_app" "my_app" {
  app_ids = [
    "..."
  ]
  display_name = "...my_display_name..."
  exclude_app_ids = [
    "..."
  ]
  only_directories = true
  page_size        = 6
  page_token       = "...my_page_token..."
  query            = "...my_query..."
}
```
