Coupa Integration Resource

This resource allows you to configure an instance of the coupa integration in ConductorOne.
It is always associated with an application. Optionally you can specify the list of users who are owners of the integration.
If owners are not specified, the integration will be owned by the user who created the resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "conductorone_integration_coupa" "coupa" {
  app_id = conductorone_app.coupa.id
  user_ids = [
    conductorone_user.admin.id
  ]
  coupa_domain                           = "..."
  oauth2_client_cred_grant_client_id     = "..."
